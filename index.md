### CPSC 120

* Lab 8

   Lab 8, Part 1 was one of my favorites because of the use of
   “if statements.” It helped me better understand them and showed me how to
   put a sandwich together. It was also one of the first times we used
   arguments which was pretty interesting.

* Lab 2

   Lab 2, Part 2 was also really interesting because this was one of the first
   ones and we used a lot of what we learned in the first lab and lectures.
   It was a lot of cout and cin but it got me more familiar with it. We also
   made a sentence from the code so that was pretty cool.

* Lab 7

   Lab 7, Part 1 was cool because we had to write the equation to get a Julian
   number into the code. It was challenging but it was nice to figure out. I
   had also never heard of a Julian day number so now I know that people who
   use it see days differently. Our continuous usage of arguments here helped
   me better understand that topic.
